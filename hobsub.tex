\maketitle

Heiko Oberdiek's \textsf{hobsub} package (and \textsf{hobsub-hyperref}
and \textsf{hobsub-generic} packages) defined a mechanism for
concatenating multiple files into a single file for faster loading.

The disadvantage is that it introduces hard dependencies between the
source files that are included and complicates distribution and
updates.

It was principally used with \textsf{hyperref} but is not currently
used in any standard packages in texlive.

The packages are still distributed as simple stubs that reference the
included packages via \verb|\RequirePackage|  rather than copying
their source.

The documented source of the original packages is available at 
\url{https://github.com/ho-tex/hobsub}
but is not distributed to CTAN.
